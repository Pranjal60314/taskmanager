## TaskManager

**This project is a spin-off from the main system — LifeOS.**
It aims to make life more navigable by **logging and reminding you of tasks** through a structured, minimal interface.

TaskManager plays well with LifeOS: while you talk into the digital void of your daily diary, LifeOS listens, and this module **automatically extracts actionable tasks** using basic word parsing. No buttons, no checklists — just reflection, and structure follows.

**Key Features:**

* Add, remove, and prioritize tasks from CLI
* Tag tasks as Important/Urgent for Eisenhower-style planning
* Persistent JSON-based storage
* Future-ready for integration with NLP and semantic intent detection

**Roadmap & Ideas:**

* Natural Language task parsing using spaCy/transformers
* A game-inspired EXP system where completing tasks gains XP
* GUI/TUI interface for visual task planning
* Notification system or voice assistant integration

This isn't just a todo list — it's your **quiet backend companion**, logging your battles while you keep moving forward.
